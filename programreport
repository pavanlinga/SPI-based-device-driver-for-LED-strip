1) As implemented, the methods used for lighting the LED ring using HRTimer and ndelay(), the delay obtained is more than the 
   required delay to be detected by WS2812 driver inorder to make High(1) and Low(0).

2) The delays required by the WS2812 driver to detect them as 1 or 0 is 
   for 1 - TH= 700ns (since asynchronous)
           TL= 600ns
   for 0 - TH = 350ns
           TL = 850ns

3) In general the time for the instruction gpio_set_value_cansleep() to be executed is more than 400ns, but to make low WS2812 driver
   the duration of the high pulse is 350ns which is less than that created using intermediate instrcution to set the gpio pin high.

4) Even by changing the delay for TH(high) and TL(low) required by the WS2812 to be detected as 1 or 0, in units of 50 the timing is not met.

5) Similarly the time taken for the instructions executed between the two delays high and low, are more than required 
   which results in timing of the WS2812 not met.
